# CANViewer
PC-Side software that interfaces with the CAN Sniffer to read, decode, and display CAN messages.

This software will use a UART interface to talk with a sniffer board that will forward messages to the PC.
CANViewer will then present the user with the messages, either raw or in a decoded format that will be
based on a configuration file provided by the user.
